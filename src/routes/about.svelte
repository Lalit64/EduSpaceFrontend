				Hi, Welcome to EduSpace this web application was created for a hackathon with the theme of
				"United Nations SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)". This app was made by a group of three
				people with the goal being to notify everyone all around the world about the global crisis'
				related to Hunger , Poverty, Pollution etc. As the world advances, there are still a lot to
				be done in order to build a world of prosperity, equality, and many other important values
				we treasure. The only way we can do that is by promoting the SDGs made by the UN. That is
				what drove us to develop this web application. With user authentication, recent topics
				around the world and videos explaining all the SDGs this web application is fully featured
				with all the needs of a basic application.
